Albert Rosen: Which way should I go first?
???: You should probably look for a button.
Albert Rosen: Great! I'll get looking! Thanks Navi
Navi: Wait Albert!
Navi: We're running on stolen time right now$so be sure to use your time sparingly.
Albert Rosen: Ok!
Navi: Don't forget that you can fast-forward$ or rewind with the right and left arrow
keys respectively.
Navi: Rewind can undo mistakes
Navi: Fast-forward allows you to zip past enemies
Navi: You can also pause with the down arrow,$but you need to hit the up arrow to un-pause.
Albert Rosen: Alright Navi I think I got it.
